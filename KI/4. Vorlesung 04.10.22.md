### Search Methods:

#### Informed Search:
- Straight line Solution
- Calculates the distence with help of a straight line (A*)
-  Greedy Search: suboptimal
- $A^*$ combines uniform cost search with greedy search
	- combines the weight with the distence
	- optimal
$$\text{Path-Max Eq.}$$
$$f(n^{'}) = max (f(n), g(n{'}) + h(n^{'}))$$
