### Agent Architectures

- Agent:
	- receives Information
	- acts according to a preformence criteria


1. Ideal Rational Agent
	- Depends on:
		- Profermance measure
		- Percept sequence
		- World knowledge
		- Possible actions
	- The agent chooses an action which maximizes its performance for a given percept sequence and knowledge about the world
	- Active sensing
2. Ideal Rational Agent
	- Ideal Mapping:
	-  Percept Sequences $\times$ World Knowledge $\rightarrow$ Actions

#### Categorization of Agents

| Agent Type               | Percepts                              | Actions                      | Goals                           | Enviroment        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Medical diagnosis system | Symotoms, findings, patient’s answers | Questions, tests, treatments | Healthy patient, minimize costs | Patient, hospital |
|Satellite image analysis system|Pixels of varying intensity, color|Print a categorization of scene|Correct categorization|Images from orbiting satellite|
|Part-picking robot|Pixels of varying intensity|Pick up parts and sort into bins|Place parts in correct bins|Conveyor belt with parts|
|Refinery controller|Temperature, pressure readings|Open, close valves; adjust temperature|Maximize purity, yield, safety|Refinery|
|Interactive English tutor|Typed words|Print exercises, suggestions, corrections|Maximize student’s score on test|Set of students|

- Learning Agents:
	- **Goal: Optimize behavior based on history actions**
	- Performance Element: Agent in the old sense
	- Critic: Tells the system how good or bad it is performing
	- Learning Element: Improves the system
	- Problem Generator: Suggests actions to test performance

- Properties of Enviroments:
	- accessible vs. nonaccessible
		- do the sensors have access to all relevent informations
	- deterministic vs. nondeterministic/stochastic
		- do old states influence the following ones
	- epoisodic vs. nonepisodic
		- dependency on history or current state
	- static vs. dynamic
		- adaption while making decisions
	- discrete vs. continuous
		- is the world limited or is it ever evolving
